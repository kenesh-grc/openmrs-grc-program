\#\# 1\. Purpose  
This Security Governance Charter defines the governance structure, roles,  
and responsibilities for managing information security and risk for a  
healthcare organization operating the OpenMRS electronic medical record

The objective of this charter is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity,  
and availability of electronic protected health information (ePHI) and  
to support compliance with applicable regulatory and security frameworks.

\- The OpenMRS application and supporting infrastructure  
\- All employees, contractors, and third-party users

\#\# 3\. Governance Framework  
The security governance program is aligned to the following frameworks:
